TODO

- mutexes, semaphores, thread helpers
- helper in sprites to increase/decrease opacity, to read a tint from vector4d, ...
- create font atlas with SDL_ttf 2.0
- bytebuffer.cpp : more functions read/write
- improve 2d rendering performances
- maybe less inline methods ?
- color (vertex, sprites)
- target for unit tests
- sprite flipX/flipY, rotation and scale
- the mouse click is sometimes ignored (IMO the input system must be redone)
- stop with these attributes name, better directory structure.

DONE

- storing the texture in the bitmap (in a bytebuffer) doesn't correctly work
- thread
