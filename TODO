- bytebuffer.cpp : more functions read/write
- vbo.cpp: why does the simple memcpy don't work on every computers ?
- threads
- storing the texture in the bitmap (in a bytebuffer) doesn't correctly work
- color (vertex, sprites)
- target for unit tests
- sprite flipX/flipY
- spriterenderer rendering if the buffer is full
- the mouse click could be ignored
